    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Latkes (potato pancakes) are a must-have at Hanukkah, but are really 
        wonderful any time of the year! This is my mother's recipe, which is
         honestly the best potato latke I've had. I usually end up making a second batch because
          they disappear so quickly. I've tried other recipes and always return to this one.
         Lovely topped with sour cream or applesauce.</p>
         <h2>Ingredients</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>3 cups shredded potato</li>
            <li>¼ cup grated onion</li>
            <li>6 saltine crackers, or as needed, crushed</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>½ cup vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
         </ul>
         <h2>Steps</h2>
         <ol>
            <li>Combine potato, onion, crushed crackers, eggs, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Heat 1/4 inch oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Drop spoonfuls of potato mixture, first pressing mixture against side of the bowl to 
                remove excess liquid, into hot oil; slightly flatten latkes 
                with the back of a spoon to make an even thickness.</li>
            <li>Cook in batches until browned and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Drain latkes on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
         </ol>
